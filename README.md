# hallucinations

Shows hallucinated fake nodes to players. The fake nodes are added and removed behind the player's back. You should never see how a fake node appears or disappears.

Hallucinations are shown per-player using the `set_observers` API proposed by appgurueu in https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/13987.
